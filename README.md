# 🚀 Deploying and Managing a Departmental Web Server on RHEL 9

👨‍💻 **Role**: Junior System Administrator  
🏢 **Company**: DevCore Solutions  
📦 **Environment**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

## 🧾 Introduction

As a junior system administrator at **DevCore Solutions**, I have been tasked with designing, deploying, and managing a secure internal web server environment using **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9)**. This project simulates real-world sysadmin responsibilities by walking through critical phases such as system setup, user and group management, web server configuration, security enforcement with SELinux, task automation, log handling, and network configuration.

Each phase of this project is designed to reflect foundational objectives from the **Altostratus Technologies Course**, helping reinforce core Linux administration skills through practical application. All tasks have been executed in a structured, documented, and security-conscious manner to simulate production-like standards.

The goal is to ensure that the development team has a stable, secure, and functional internal web platform while maintaining best practices in Linux system administration.

## 📌 Phase 1: Initial Setup and User Management

🗓️ **Summary**:  
I began by installing RHEL 9 on the server, configuring essential system settings like hostname and timezone to fit our company standards. After updating the system to the latest packages, I created three user accounts (`devalpha`, `devbeta`, and `devadmin`) tailored for the development team. To streamline permissions management, I created a group called `developers` and added all these users to it. Finally, I secured administrative privileges by configuring `devadmin` with passwordless sudo access through a dedicated sudoers configuration file.

🔸 Output of `id devalpha`  
🔸 Output of `sudo -l -U devadmin`

## 📌 Phase 2: Directory and Permission Configuration

🗓️ **Summary**:  
With the users set up, I focused on building a clear directory structure under `/opt/devweb` to organize our web application files and support directories. I created subfolders for configuration files, logs, scripts, and HTML content. To facilitate collaborative work, I assigned group ownership of these directories to the `developers` group. Setting the SGID bit on the `scripts` directory ensured that all new files automatically inherit the group ownership, maintaining consistent access controls.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Output of `ls -lR /opt/devweb`  
🔸 Commands used for `chmod` and `chgrp`

## 📌 Phase 3: Apache Installation and Configuration

🗓️ **Summary**:  
I installed the Apache HTTP server using the system’s package manager, then enabled and started its service to run on system boot. To serve the internal website, I created a simple `index.html` file in the `/opt/devweb/html` directory. I modified the Apache configuration to update the `DocumentRoot` to this new directory. Because SELinux is enforcing on the system, I configured the appropriate SELinux file contexts and applied them to the web directory. Lastly, I opened port 80 on the firewall to allow HTTP traffic.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Snippet of updated `httpd.conf` showing the new DocumentRoot  
🔸 Output of `ls -Z /opt/devweb/html` with SELinux contexts  
🔸 Output of `firewall-cmd --list-all`

## 📌 Phase 4: Scheduled Maintenance and Backup Automation

🗓️ **Summary**:  
To protect our web data, I developed a backup script that copies the website content to a backup directory with a timestamp for versioning. I scheduled this backup to run automatically every day at 1 AM using `crontab` under the `devadmin` user account. Additionally, I tested the scheduling system by creating a one-time `at` job to reboot the server after a 10-minute delay.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Output of `crontab -l -u devadmin`  
🔸 Contents of `backup.sh` script  
🔸 Output of `atq`

## 📌 Phase 5: Networking Configuration

🗓️ **Summary**:  
I configured the server’s primary network interface (`eth0`) to use a static IP address (`192.168.1.100/24`) and set the DNS resolver to Google’s public DNS (`8.8.8.8`) using NetworkManager’s CLI tools. To verify the network settings, I inspected the IP address assignment, checked active connections, tested connectivity to external hosts with `ping`, and confirmed local web access using `curl`.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Output of `ip a`  
🔸 Output of `nmcli con show`  
🔸 Contents of `/etc/hosts`  
🔸 Contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`

## 📌 Phase 6: Archiving and Logs

🗓️ **Summary**:  
I archived the accumulated web server logs into a compressed tarball stored in `/tmp` for easier management and transfer. To prevent log accumulation from filling disk space, I set up a monthly cron job using the `find` command to delete log files older than 30 days, automating log maintenance.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Output of `tar -tzf /tmp/devlogs.tar.gz`  
🔸 Cron job configuration  
🔸 `find` command used for cleanup

## 📌 Phase 7: SELinux and Service Management

🗓️ **Summary**:  
SELinux enforcement was confirmed to be active, requiring that I configure appropriate security contexts for the custom web directory. Using `semanage fcontext`, I labeled `/opt/devweb/html` so Apache could access it without issues, and applied these labels with `restorecon`. To ensure the web server is always running after reboot, I enabled the `httpd` service to start on boot.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Output of `getenforce`  
🔸 Output of `semanage fcontext` rule  
🔸 Output of `restorecon -Rv /opt/devweb/html`

## 📌 Phase 8: Troubleshooting and Logs

🗓️ **Summary**:  
To prepare for real-world failures, I intentionally stopped the Apache service and examined the resulting error logs using both `journalctl` and the Apache error log file. I monitored running processes with `top` and `ps` and practiced terminating a stuck process using `kill -9` to ensure system stability and responsiveness.

📸 **Deliverables**:  
🔸 Screenshot or logs of the Apache error  
🔸 Output showing use of `top`, `ps`, and `kill`  
🔸 Recovery steps and resolutions
